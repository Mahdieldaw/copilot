Project Brief: Hybrid Thinking - MVP v0.2 (Post-AI Execution)1. Introduction & VisionHybrid Thinking is a web platform designed to empower users, particularly those without deep technical AI expertise, to define, configure, execute, and manage AI-driven tasks and, eventually, multi-stage workflows. The platform aims to provide structure and reusability to AI interactions, moving beyond simple, isolated prompts.MVP Vision (Evolving): To deliver a robust tool where users can leverage predefined "archetypes" to structure AI tasks, execute them against language models, receive and review outputs, and lay the groundwork for more complex workflow orchestration, validation, and a "workflow memory" system.Core Problem Solved (Current Focus): Provides a structured interface for configuring and executing individual AI-powered tasks based on archetypes. It allows users to dynamically generate prompts, interact with an AI model (currently Gemini), and receive responses, forming the foundational block for more advanced workflow capabilities.2. Current Status & Capabilities (as of May 2025)The mahdieldaw-copilot application currently offers the following:Archetype-Driven Configuration: Users can select from various "archetypes" (e.g., "Ideation & Exploration," "Drafting & Creation") that define the structure of an AI task.Dynamic Input Forms: The UI dynamically generates input fields (text, sliders, dropdowns, tags, checkboxes) based on the selected archetype's configuration.Live Prompt Templating: Users can see a real-time preview of the AI prompt as they fill in the input fields. The underlying prompt template for the archetype is also editable by the user.AI Model Execution:The application can send the configured and user-edited prompt to a Large Language Model (currently integrated with the Gemini API via a client-side service).It supports streaming responses from the AI model.The UI displays the AI's output, along with loading and error states.Users can trigger AI runs and cancel them.Basic UI for Interaction:A tabbed interface separates task configuration from the AI preview and execution panel.Includes options to reset inputs to default and regenerate AI responses.Placeholder actions for copying output and providing feedback are present.Technology Stack (Client-Side Core):Frontend: React, TypeScript, Vite.Styling: Custom CSS (as seen in App.css).AI Service: Direct client-side integration with the Gemini API.State Management: React hooks (useState, useEffect, custom hook useAIExecution).3. Next MVP Goals (Building on Current Capabilities)The immediate next steps should focus on solidifying the current single-stage execution and expanding towards foundational workflow features:Enhanced AI Interaction & Output Handling:Improve the display and formatting of AI outputs.Implement robust error handling and user feedback for API issues (e.g., quota limits, content blocking by API).Integrate the "Copy Output" and "Feedback" functionalities more fully.Archetype & Configuration Persistence:Allow users to save a fully configured archetype instance (inputs + potentially modified prompt template) as a reusable "task component" or "snapshot."Enable loading these saved configurations to quickly re-run or adapt previous tasks.Introduction of Basic Validation:Implement a simple manual validation step (e.g., user marks output as "Good" or "Needs Improvement") for the AI output. This is the first step towards the OutputValidator concept.Log this validation status.Rudimentary History/Logging:Store a local history of executed prompts and their corresponding AI outputs and validation status.User Authentication (Foundation):Integrate a basic authentication system (e.g., Firebase Auth, Supabase Auth, or Clerk as previously considered) to allow users to save their work under their account. This is critical for persistence beyond local storage.UI/UX Polish:Refine the overall user interface for better clarity, ease of use, and visual appeal, potentially incorporating a UI component library like shadcn/ui if desired.Improve responsiveness and accessibility.4. Target Audience (Continuing)Individuals or small teams exploring structured AI usage (e.g., content creators, analysts, researchers, process improvers, marketers).Users comfortable with web applications but not necessarily AI coding/APIs â€“ the "AI Layman."Early adopters willing to provide feedback on an evolving workflow tool.5. Core Technology Stack (Evolving MVP)Frontend: React, TypeScript, Vite (current). Consider integrating shadcn/ui or another component library for accelerated UI development.State Management: React Hooks (current). Evaluate Zustand or TanStack Query if/when state complexity significantly increases with multi-stage workflows.AI Service Integration: Direct client-side calls to Gemini API (current). Plan for a backend abstraction layer for future model-agnostic execution and to securely manage API keys.Backend (Future Need for Persistence & Advanced Features): Consider NestJS (Node.js, TypeScript) or Firebase Functions.Database (Future Need for Persistence): Consider PostgreSQL (e.g., via Supabase, Neon) or Firestore.Authentication (Near-term Need): Clerk, Supabase Auth, or Firebase Authentication.This revised brief aims to accurately capture your project's current momentum and set clear, achievable goals for the next iteration of your MVP.
